        I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), but my journey into tech wasn't always linear. I've always been fascinated by problem-solving and creative solutions, which initially led me to study design. However, I soon realized that my true passion was in coding, where I could combine my creative instincts with technical expertise to build meaningful, user-focused applications.

Starting as a self-taught developer, I dove deep into JavaScript, learning through hands-on projects and collaborating with online communities. Over time, I refined my skills by working on real-world applications.

I believe in continuous learning, always keeping up with the latest technologies and best practices to provide my clients with cutting-edge solutions. For me, freelancing is not just about coding â€” it's about building relationships, solving real-world problems, and delivering value.

At the core of everything I do is a commitment to delivering high-quality, scalable, and user-centric solutions. I approach each project with a sense of purpose, knowing that the work I do has a real impact on my clients' success.        </p>
